                            I'm a determined, aspiring developer with a passion for technology. I am driven by learning new skills, and over the past two years I have worked hard to complete the Web

                            While I consider myself a developer first, I value the importance of designing an appealing product. I love problem-solving and have built strong skills in web-development
                            languages including HTML, CSS, PHP and JavaScript. Additionally, I am well educated in UI/UX, Graphic Design, Project Management and Social Media monitoring. I am very
                            ambitious, and always try to maintain a high level of quality in my work.

                            With my sights set on the future, I'm committed to translating my customer service skills and dedicated work ethic toward a new career in the tech industry. I look forward
                            to applying my passion for technology in all the work that I do.
