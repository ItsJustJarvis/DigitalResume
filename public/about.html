                        <p>
                            I'm Reeve, a determined aspiring developer with a passion for technology. I am driven by learning new skills, and over the past two years I have worked hard to complete the
                            Web and Mobile App Development program at North Island college, graduating in high standing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While I consider myself a developer first, I value the importance of designing an appealing product. I love problem-solving and have built strong skills in web-development
                            languages including HTML, CSS, PHP and JavaScript. Additionally, I am well educated in UI/UX, Graphic Design, Project Management and Social Media monitoring. I am very
                            ambitious, and always try to maintain a high level of quality in my work.
                        </p>
                        <p>With my sights set on the future, I'm committed to translating my customer service skills and dedicated work ethic toward a new career in the tech industry.</p>

                                Attending Brock University out of high-school, I explored my interests towards a future career in communications and media. Leaving on good terms, I decided to pursue
                                other opportunities in Western Canada. Eventually leading to my current placement at North Island College and the returned pursuit of a career in tech.

                                Pine Ridge Secondary is a well regarded secondary school located in Durham Region, Ontario. The rich catalogue of university level courses and extracurriculars allowed
                                me to pursue my interests and develop important skills. Throughout my time at Pine Ridge I was an editor for the Year-Book committee, and took part in organizing and
                                maintaining various school events. I graduated in high standing in 2011.
